This is the unification of some "loose" code files and web pages. It is intended to be a Content Creator's Studio where hey can: edit videos (on the "Fasttrack Video Editor Tool), get some code assintance for 3d model rigging morphs with the "Code Assintant" (AI agent conected to a deepseek model on LM Studio), and the Creator's Tool, where content creators can be AI asisted (an AI Agent connected to Llava on ollama), to create: stories, charachters, worlds, and scenes.
This "Content Cretor's Playground" would be a part of a much larger Media Platform, it would start with a landing page where the user should log in, in order to freely use all the AI asisted tools (this is intented to be only for content creators, who are part of the said "Media Platform" with a verified account).
After the landing page the will be a "Hub" (Home) page with all the available tool and other secction (tabs) for future links to other seccions such articles, assts sharing (rigging morphs for 3d models) or such, on the nav bar will be only the Title of the Hub ( Content Creator's Playground) and 3 buttons (witn links) to the other tools pages, Fasttrack AI (AI asisted video editor), Story Director AI (story, characthers, scenes, and worlds creation), and the AI Code Assistant button link.
Every tools web page wouldd have  on the nav bar, the Home button- icon link, and some other button link for related pages.
